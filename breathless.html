<div class="pullquote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 25px;">I couldn't breathe.</div>

<p>I pushed my way through the crowded Roman
bus station, unable to speak one word of Italian.
In fact, I couldn’t speak at all. My throat was
swollen shut. I looked and sounded like
a 50-year-old chain smoker.
<p>
“Dove è il prossimo bus?” I croaked.
<p>
Determined to find the correct bus stop
I carefully recited the Italian phrase for, “Where
is the next bus?” that my roommate, Alicia,
taught me. I wish I paid more attention when
she practiced speaking Italian in the morning.
One of the friendly guards pointed toward
the west end of Rome’s Termini bus station.
Short of breath, I weaved through the crowds.
I was a 5-foot-nothing Mexican girl bundled
in a thick winter coat, wool scarf and matching
gloves in the middle of the warmest Italian
summer on record. In the background people
cheered me on, but I couldn’t look back. I had
to keep running. I was alone in Italy with a high
fever and a sore throat, carrying more luggage
than a girl my size should.
<p>
I had the trip many 20-year-olds only
dream of. Alicia left Cal State Fullerton to study
abroad in the spring and asked me to join her
in Rome to explore Europe. I had always heard
stories of Eurotrips gone wrong, but dismissed
them as the kind of thing that only happens in the
movies. We traveled through Italy, France, Malta
and England before landing in Spain.

<p>
I was determined to have a memorable trip
in Europe. I wanted to see everything these
countries had to offer. We gazed at the historic
Roman Colosseum, climbed the Eiffel Tower and
rode the London Eye.

<p>
In Madrid, we set off for a tour of the historic
Spanish capital. It was 85 degrees. I wasn’t used to
the constant climate change and was fighting a fever.
My body was telling me to slow down.
<p>
Our tour group met in Plaza del Sol on a sunny
June morning, when a smallscale sand storm hit.
We were instructed to take cover, but I was too
late. My allergies were set off and my eyes swelled
up like balloons.
<p>
“Do you wanna go back to the hostel?
You look like hell,” Alicia said.
<p>
“No, I’m fine. Keep moving.”
<p>
I didn’t want to ruin our trip. I bought cough
medicine and eye drops at the local pharmacy
instead. By the time we got back to our room,
I felt dizzy. I couldn’t control my breathing. I took
the cough medicine and went straight to bed.

<p>
I woke my roommate up in a frantic
cry for help at around 3 a.m. Sweating
and shivering, I reached for anything that
could keep me war m. If I wasn’t scared
before, the nervous look on Alicia’s face
did the trick. She was panicking. After
wrapping me up in several layers of sweat
pants and blankets, she resolved to slee p
on top of me for body heat. I shivered
until I blacked our.

<P>
Our flight to Rome left early the next
morning. Alicia helped me through the
airport, making sure I was hydrated.
She attempted to feed me to no avail.
My throat was swollen shut, forcing us
to communicate with a pen and pencil.
After various trips to the pharmacy
and countless doses of antibiotics, the
swelling in my throat finally went down.
I thought about taking an early flight home
with Alicia – her flight was scheduled two
days before mine.

<p>
I couldn’t bring myself to leave.
I convinced myself I would get better.
Reluctantly, Alicia left me in Rome with
enough water and antibiotics to stay alive.
I wish she had left her English-to-Italian
dictionary too.

<p>
My new found health was short lived.
My throat began to swell up again once I was
alone. I felt lethargic and struggled to get out
of bed to use the bathroom or eat.
This was the first symptom of Lemierre’s
syndrome. The bacterial infection creates
an abscess – a pocket filled with blood –
near the tonsils, causing severe swelling around
the neck. I figured it was just fever. It would
go away. I romanticized the entire situation
in my hazy trip.

<p>
Being sick in Rome was better than being
sick in middle of nowhere, California.
It was 8 a.m. and I couldn’t stop sprinting
through Termini. If I missed the bus, I would
have to find a cab to Leonardo da Vinci –
Fiumicino Airport for the hefty price of 50
euros. I cursed Alicia’s name a thousand
times. Why couldn’t she convince me to leave?
I made it to the west end of Termini
to the Terravision stop. Tears of joy ran
down my face as I saw the bright purple
bus awaiting my arrival. My blood ran cold
when I realized the bus was empty.

<p>
No one was allowed to board because
of maintenance. The next bus would depart
at 10 a.m. I had to move quickly. I ran back
across Termini to catch a cab, knocking
people over. The cheers that filled the bus
station moments ago quickly turned into
angry shouting.

<p>
Once at Fiumicino Airport, I ran to the
check-in desk. “I’m here to check in for the
11 a.m. flight to Los Angeles.” The flight
attendant was visibly annoyed.
<p>
“I’m sorry, but you’ll have to see the
front desk We stopped checking that flight
in eight minutes ago.”
<p>
“No!” I cried. “Please, you have to let
me board. I can’t stay here. Please, you don’t
understand.” By then a crowd had gathered
at the check-in booth. I saw security coming
and tried my best to pull it together. I couldn’t
help it – tears filled my eyes.</p>

<img src="nereida-1.png">
<div class="pullquote">I couldn't see anymore.</div>

<p>I was experiencing photophobia, the
second symptom of Lemierre’s syndrome.
Photophobia causes temporary blindness.
Patients report seeing bright colors before
blacking out.

<p>
The security guard caught me before
I hit the ground. 

<p> I quickly snapped back
to reality. The guard let me stand by myself.
I didn’t let them call a doctor. I needed
to go home.

<p>
The flight attendant switched my seat
to the next available flight in 12 hours.
I set up camp in the airport, determined
to stay awake. I was not going to miss
my flight again. I found a spot on the cold
ground. It wasn’t very comfortable, but
it would have to do.


<div class="pullquote">I felt pain in my chest.</div>
<p>As I dozed off, I felt a sharp pain
in my chest. This is the third symptom
of Lemierre’s syndrome. Bacteria makes
its way down a pulmonary vein and into
the heart vessels. Many patients experience
sharp pains and shortness of breath, leading
to severe pneumonia.

<p>
I struggled to breathe steadily, which
caught the attention of a friendly looking
couple nearby. Before they had the chance
to say anything, I got defensive.

<p>
“I’m fine. It’s just a cough, it will go
away,” I said.
<p>
They smiled, and turned away.
Once I could check in, I dragged my
bags to the front desk.

<p>
I made quite an impression on the airport
staff. The woman at the counter from the day
before pulled me to the side. She seemed
apologetic as she instructed me to follow her
to the back. The head of airport security –
a tall, proud-looking man with a thick, black
mustache and a neatly pressed royal blue
uniform – greeted me at the entrance.
<p>
“What are you doing in Rome?” he asked.
<p>
“I’m on vacation.”
<p>
“I heard about your situation yesterday.
Are you sick?” I panicked. 
<p>
“No, I mean I had
a slight cough but it’s gone now.”
<p>
He explained that I could not board the
plane if I was too sick, not wanting to put the
other passengers in danger.
<p>
After a brief conversation, he instructed the
woman from the front desk to thoroughly inspect
my bags. He turned to me as he walked away.
<p>
  “I have eyes throughout the entire airport.
I want you to know, we’re all keeping an eye
on you,” he warned. I leaned against the wall,
trying desperately to keep from collapsing.

<p>
“Great,” I grumbled to myself. “They think
I’m a terrorist.” The woman handed me a chair
as soon as the security guard was out of sight.
She must have pitied me as I watched her tear
apart the neatly packed bags.

<p>
Once I was cleared, she escorted me through
a second round of security and onto my seat
on the plane. I arrived at the Los Angeles
International Airport, at 9 p.m.
My mother and grandfather welcomed
me at the airport with open arms. I hugged
them as tight as I could.

<p>
“Mom, I need to go to the hospital,”
I said. She looked puzzled.
<p>
“Mija, you’re pale. What’s wrong?” she
said. <p> The terminal spun.

<div class="pullquote">I gasped for air.</div>

This is the fourth symptom of Lemierre’s
syndrome. The bacteria spreads from your
heart and into your lungs, causing tiny lesions
within the tissue. The fluid in and around the
lungs causes them to collapse.

<p>
I should have called an ambulance right
away but I didn’t want to scare my grandfather.

<p>
I persuaded my mom to wait to call the hospital
until we got him home. It was an hour drive
to San Bernardino.

<p>
I arrived at Loma Linda University Hospital’s
emergency room at 10 p.m. and was quickly
admitted to the intensive care unit. It took three
days, two computed tomography (CT) scans and
daily blood work for the doctors to diagnose my
illness. Lemierre’s syndrome is extremely rare
– it’s commonly referred to as the “forgotten
disease.” The incidence rate is 0.8 cases per
million in the general population. Doctors say
it’s most common in healthy young adults,
such as myself.

<p>
Tubes and wires ran through my body.
I had a chest tube on either side to drain the
fluids that filled my collapsed lungs.

<p>
I had a new nurse everyday during my twoweek
hospital stay. I never got tired of seeing
the bewildered look on their faces as they
wondered what Lemierre’s syndrome was.

<p>
Some even googled the disease in front of me.
It was a parent’s nightmare. They blamed
themselves for the whole mess. My mother
constantly mumbled about how she shouldn’t
have let me go to Europe in the first place.
Terrified, she brought a priest in to sprinkle
me with holy water.

<p>         
The severity of my illness was lost
on me during my hospital stay. Death never
crossed my mind. I was annoyed, more than
anything. Hospitals make me uncomfortable.
I hated being confined to a bed for 15 days,
unable to walk on my own.

<p>
Once I was released, the doctors ordered
me to relax and to stay indoors. I was strapped
to a machine through a peripherally inserted
central catheter (PICC) line in my arm that fed
me antibiotics for an additional three weeks.
The possibility of my lungs recollapsing
is very real – Lemierre’s syndrome may return
at a moment’s notice. I’ve been forced to adapt
a healthier lifestyle, and even quit smoking
at the behest of my doctor. My father quit
smoking in solidarity.

<p>
Despite my discomfort of the doctor’s office,
I can’t ignore my body’s warnings. I’ve learned
to tone down my stubborn nature to seek
medical attention at the first sign of a problem.
The overwhelming support of my friends and
family has shown me that I can get through
anything – even a rare lung disease. Given time,
I am confident my body will make a full recovery.
